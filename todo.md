  - [ ] cli to crud that conf file
  - [ ] if both anthropic and openai tokens exist, choose one
- [ ] test with all terminals and also consider oh-my-posh support
- [ ] add multiple theme support currently hardcoded here: `prime/cmd/mcp.go`
- [ ] learn more about go pinnings and how to use/update them. So far not fun at all!
- [ ] more tests with different mcp servers
